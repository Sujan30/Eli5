In a world of complex topics, and wannabe know everythings, who use advance terms to make it complex, 
We introduce a different solution, called ELI5, whose main focus is to explain topics of any complexity as simple as possible. 

ELI5 stands for
Explain
Like 
I'm
5 years old

This is essentially a search engine that answers and explains topics and questions using very simple terminongly, such that even a 5 year old can understand.

This isn't only for 5 year olds, but intended for everyones' use, as a way to learn more complex topics in a simpler fashion. 

We do this by using the OpenAI API and changing the prompt to get an AI generated message that basically finds an easier way to explain the topic.

This project was inspired by Albert Einstein who once said 
"Any fool can make something complicated. It takes a genius to make it simple."
